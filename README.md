Chord
=====

Chord is an [ES6] framework that uses [Traceur] to compile to ES5.


ES6 compatibility
=====

Not all ES6 features have been implemented by Traceur. See the [Traceur/ES6 compatibility table].


HTML Templating
=====

ES6 supports template strings. They seem flexible enough, but if they end up not working out, we can use Jade.

Development roadmap
=====

- Bare bones! At first, we won't integrate with other js libraries. 
- modules. Try using ES6 module syntax. Otherwise use requirejs.
- make simple MVC.
